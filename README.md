Participating in the Advent of Code 2022

This Repo contains solutions for each Challenge in the Advent of Code '22 Event that has been created and organised by:

All the Solutions were made as fast as I could, so pardon the code if it is not optimal enough. In hindsight there were a lot of things that could've been done to make the code faster and/or shorten it. Considering that this is my first Advent Of Code Event, I think I am doing alright! Thank you for checking out my solutions! Any advice is welcome and can be sent through my Discord DMs(ID mentioned below!). Thanks!

**PS: If you want Input File(s) or the Input File formats, kindly DM me on Discord at Indie#0969. Cheerio!**
