This Repo contains solutions for each Challenge in the Advent of Code '22 event that has been created and organised by:

All the Solutions were made in under 3-6 minutes, so pardon the code if it is not optimal enough. In hindsight there were a lot of this that could've been done to optimise the code and/or shorten it. Considering that this is my first Advent Of Code Event, I think I am doing alright! Thank you for checking out my solutions! Any advice is welcome and can be sent through my Discord DMs(ID mentioned below!). Thanks!

**PS: If you want Input File(s) or the Input File formats, kindly DM me on Discord at Indie#0969. Cheerio!**
